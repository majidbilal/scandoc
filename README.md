image management

It's a project to help manage images whether scanned, photographed or downloaded.
The aim behind developing this is to tag images with proper vocabulary related to the images so that they can be searched
and used when required.

It implements a simple workflow as well, controlled through group permissioning. So, a "kpo" will upload the image with proper tagging, a "qa" will proofread the tags and verify that the information entered is correct, and then the "approver" will aprove the image to be part of the repository and searchable.

Then there's a search facility by which images can be searched and can be converted to PDF.

All of this requires users to be logged in.

and thats it :) ... !
